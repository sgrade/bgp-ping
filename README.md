# bgp-ping
Connectivity test for a BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) peer

Original idea and some code to start from is from [https://github.com/cloverstd/tcping](https://github.com/cloverstd/tcping). Then it is being simplified for BGP and re-written as a client/server app.

## Sample report of oririnal tcping and monolithic bgping
```

Ping statistics tcp://10.0.12.11:179
        4 probes sent.
        4 successful, 0 failed.
Approximate trip times:
        Minimum = 345.467µs, Maximum = 982.225µs, Average = 524.15µs
